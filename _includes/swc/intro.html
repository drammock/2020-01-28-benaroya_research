  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including program design, version control, data management,
  and task automation.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

      Note from the instructors: when you install the required software (in advance of the workshop!) please install a GUI text editor too, as a backup in case something goes wrong with your command-line text editor. If you're not sure which one to pick, pick Sublime Text.
